# video-graph
Refines [`@davidisaaclee/graph`](https://github.com/davidisaaclee/graph-ts) to model a graph of WebGL fragment shaders.

See [`@davidisaaclee/react-video-graph`](https://github.com/davidisaaclee/react-video-graph) to see this package in action.

## Install
```bash
yarn add @davidisaaclee/video-graph
```

## Develop
```bash
# Build using tsc (does not bundle into single file)
yarn build
```

## Todo
- Add tests (not certain the best way to do this)
- Add usage to readme
- Break out WebGL helpers into separate package
